# Retailery

Retailery is an E-commerce app that allows "sellers" to list products and "shoppers" to shop for them. Retailery's prime feature is that it allows the visitors of the app to search for a product and mark out the shops selling that product over a map view. Sellers get a map view of the shops near them that sell the product that they require. 

Retailery is bootstrapped using create-react-app and uses Redux for state management. The backend is mounted on Google Firebase. A combination of both REST APIs and GraphQL is used to interact with the backend. Code for the backend is available at https://github.com/devgeetech/retailery-api

Retailery was developed in 2019 and is no longer maintained.
